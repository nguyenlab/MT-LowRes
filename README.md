# NMT_LowRec

The repository is for the following research:

Utilizing Neural Machine Translation for Low-Resource Languages

This work utilized NMT [1] for low-resource languages. Experiments were conducted on the following language pairs:

1. Japanese-English

2. Czech-English

3. English-Vietnamese

4. Indonesian-Vietnamese

5. Czech-Vietnamese
