The repository is for the following research:

## Investigating Phrase-Based and Neural-Based Machine Translation onLow-Resource Settings

We conduct an investigation of phrase-based and neural-based machine translation on low-resource language pairs, which contain small bilingual corpora. Experiments were conducted on several language pairs:

1. Japanese-English

2. English-Vietnamese

3. Indonesian-Vietnamese

4. Czech-Vietnamese
